name: new-session
description: Turn a game-session transcript into site updates — writes the new session journal entry and creates/updates every character, NPC, place, the campaign overview and the map it touches. Use when the user pastes a session transcript (usually Italian, often messy speech-to-text), points at a transcript file such as audio/session-NN.txt, or asks to "add/process/write up the latest session".

# New session

Turn a raw transcript into a complete, cross-linked update of the site. All content you write is in **Italian**; follow the conventions in `CLAUDE.md` (wikilinks, spoilers, canonical names, don'ts).

The transcript is either pasted in the conversation or in a file passed as the argument. Automatic transcripts contain misheard words and mangled names — never silently guess: resolve what you can, and list the rest in the final report.

**Public site.** The site is public and indexed:

- Players are referred to only by their characters. Transcripts are full of real names ("Marco, tira l'iniziativa"): work out which character each player runs from context and the existing `personaggi/` files, and never write a real name anywhere.
- Write only what the party learned in play. Skip DM asides and explanations, out-of-character chatter, things the DM said by mistake and took back, and secrets one character learned privately unless they shared them with the group.

## 1. Gather context

Before writing anything:

- Grep `^numero:` in `src/content/sessions/` to get the next session number (highest + 1), then read the latest one or two sessions for continuity and tone.
- Read `src/content/riassunto/overview.md` for the current state of the campaign.
- Grep `^titolo:` in `src/content/personaggi/`, `png/` and `luoghi/` for the list of existing entities. Every name you meet in the transcript must be matched against it — including near-misses from speech recognition (e.g. "Vargas Vallakovich" → `Barone Vargas`, "Ismarc" → `Ismark Kolyanovich`).
- For names you can't match, check canonical spelling in the module reference named in `CLAUDE.local.md` (if there is none, flag the name in the report instead). Use it for spelling and to disambiguate only — never bring in anything the party hasn't learned in play.

## 2. Write the session

Create `src/content/sessions/sessione-NN.md` (NN zero-padded):

```yaml
---
titolo: <evocative title>
numero: <N>
data: <YYYY-MM-DD — the real session date if known; interactively, ask if unknown; otherwise today and flag it>
estratto: <1-2 sentences, max 300 characters (schema-enforced)>
luoghiVisitati: [<titolo of each place the party was physically in — this is what marks a place as visited on the map>]
tag: [<optional, short>]
---
```

Body: a third-person narrative in Italian that summarises what happened, split into `##` sections by scene. Past tense or narrative present consistent with earlier sessions. Keep it readable prose — no raw transcript, no out-of-character table talk, no rules chatter unless it matters to the story. Link every entity on its first mention in each section.

## 3. Create new entities

For each character, NPC or place that appears for the first time, create a file named after the kebab-case, accent-free title (e.g. `padre-lucian-petrovich.md`). Fields besides `titolo` are optional; fill in what is known, use `sconosciuto` for things that matter but aren't known yet.

- `personaggi/` (player characters): `titolo`, `classe`, `stato` (`vivo`|`morto`|`scomparso`|`ritirato`), `fazione`, `estratto`, `tag`. Leave `giocatore` out (no real names). Set `immagine: /images/personaggi/<id>.png` only if that file exists.
- `png/`: `titolo`, `ruolo`, `stato` (`vivo`|`morto`|`scomparso`|`sconosciuto`), `fazione`, `luogo`, `estratto`, `tag`.
- `luoghi/`: `titolo`, `tipo`, `regione`, `estratto`, `tag`. Whether a place was visited comes from the sessions' `luoghiVisitati`, not from the place.

Body: a short Italian paragraph with what the party knows and how they met it, linked back to the session and other entities.

## 4. Update existing entities

For each existing entity that appears again:

- Update frontmatter that changed: `stato` (e.g. `morto`), `luogo`, `ruolo`, `estratto` if it's now misleading.
- **Append** a paragraph describing the new development. Don't rewrite earlier history.
- Player characters: note significant personal moments (choices, injuries, items, relationships).

## 5. Overview and map

- Update `src/content/riassunto/overview.md` only if the campaign's overall state changed meaningfully (goal reached, new faction, new region, major death). Append or adjust the relevant section; don't rewrite it.
- The map (`src/pages/mappa.astro`) shows only headline places (not shops inside a town). Pin colours follow the sessions' `luoghiVisitati` automatically. If the party reached a new headline place or travelled a new road, move the road from `knownRoads` to `travelledRoads` when it already exists; don't invent coordinates for new pins — list them in the report so the user can place them.

## 6. Verify

Run `pnpm build` and check the output:

- It must succeed (schema errors, e.g. `estratto` over 300 characters, fail the build).
- Fix every `[wikilinks] Unresolved link` warning by correcting the target or creating the missing entity.

## 7. Report

End with a short report:

- Session file created, entities created, entities updated.
- **Ambiguities**: every name or detail you had to interpret, with your choice (e.g. "«Strad» → Strahd von Zarovich", "unclear whether Izek died: left `stato: vivo`").
- Anything left for the user: map pins to place, a missing session date, and for new player characters the portraits to add in `public/images/personaggi/` (`<id>.png` square + `<id>-full.png` tall; the home page picks up the full one automatically, then set `immagine`).
- A suggested commit message, e.g. `feat(content): add sessione-11`.

Don't commit — the user reviews `git diff` first.
